## Overview

Early in Spring 2023, I decided that I wanted to take some photos of MSU's campus
on a couple of walks. I also decided to use this time to test out black and white photography,
particularly with Ilford HP5 shot pushed to 1600 ISO. I had seen some good results with this film,
and some photos I took turned out quite nice.

## Sanford Natural Area

One of my walks was through the Sanford Natural Area, which is a preserve located right in the middle
of MSU's campus. It was quite barren when I walked around, so there wasn't a ton to take pictures of, but I still
found some stuff to capture.

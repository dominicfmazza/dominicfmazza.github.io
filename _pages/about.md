Hello! I'm Dominic Mazza, an undergraduate researcher at Michigan State University who focuses on
autonomous systems and computer vision.

Currently, I lead the Autonomous Vehicle Club, an interdisciplinary
student organization that focuses on making a modified 2017 Chevy Bolt autonomous. I also am
working with the WAVES lab at MSU on sensor-fusion and object detection techniques.

In the future, I hope to earn a Ph.D. in Computer Science with a concentration doing robotics,
and continue my efforts in academia.

Hello! I'm Dominic Mazza, an undergraduate researcher at Michigan State University who focuses on
autonomous systems and computer vision. As a part of my responsibilities, I work with:

- Python
- Pytorch
- ROS
- C++
- GitLab CI/CD & Github Actions

Currently, I lead the Autonomous Vehicle Club, an interdisciplinary
student organization that focuses on making a modified 2017 Chevy Bolt autonomous. I also am
working with the WAVES lab at MSU on sensor-fusion and object detection techniques.

As I graduate this semester, I am looking for new opportunities in the robotics industry, the computer
vision space, or anything to do with automation and Python.
Take a look at my [resume](/cv) and contact me about any positions you'd like me to fill!
